## Object-Oriented Data Structures and Algorithms Course - 2280 Iowa State

Course Overview

This repository contains lab exercises and projects from my Object-Oriented Data Structures and Algorithms course. The course emphasizes an object-oriented approach to data structures and algorithms, focusing on analysis, design, and programming.

Key Topics Covered:
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design: Understanding the principles of object-oriented design and programming.
Data Abstraction: Techniques for creating abstract data types and ensuring correctness.
Inheritance and Subtype Polymorphism: Leveraging inheritance and polymorphism in designing extensible software.
Generics: Implementing generic data structures and algorithms for type safety and flexibility.
Collections: Exploring various data structures, including:
Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees
Heaps
Maps
Hash Tables
Graphs
Algorithm Analysis: Understanding Big-O notation and analyzing the efficiency of algorithms.
Searching and Sorting: Implementing and analyzing common searching and sorting algorithms.
Graph Algorithms: Learning graph search algorithms and finding shortest paths.
